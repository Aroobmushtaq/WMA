# ✨ Learning Next.js 
This folder is for practicing and understanding **Next.js** — especially how **routing**, **folder structure**, and **rendering methods (CSR & SSR)** work.

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications with built-in features like:

###  Features of Next.js (Simple Explanation)

- **Easy Routing**  
  You don’t need React Router. Just create files in the `pages` folder — they become your website pages.

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**  
  The page is made on the server before it shows in the browser. It's good for SEO and fast loading.

- **API Routes**  
  You can make backend API (data) files inside the `pages/api` folder.

- **Image Optimization**  
  Next.js makes your images load faster and work well on all devices.

- **CSS Support**  
  You can write CSS . Use it globally or only inside one component.

- **Fast Website**  
  Next.js makes your website fast by loading only what’s needed.

- **Easy to Deploy**  
  You can host your site on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) in just one click.

## 🔁 SSR vs CSR (Simple Comparison)

### 🟩 SSR – Server-Side Rendering
- The page is built on the **server** before it reaches the browser.
- **Content appears instantly** with data already loaded.
- Very good for **SEO** (search engines can read it).
- Best for: blogs, news sites, and pages that need fresh data every time.

---

### 🟦 CSR – Client-Side Rendering
- The browser loads a **blank page first**, then uses JavaScript to add content.
- Slower first load, but faster navigation after that.
- Not good for SEO (because content loads later).
- Best for: dashboards, logged-in areas, or apps where SEO doesn't matter.
