# Git 

Git is a version control system used by developers to track and manage changes in their code.

## üìò What I‚Äôm Learning

- What is Git and GitHub
- How to initialize a repository
- How to create branches
- How to stage, commit, push, and pull changes
- How to merge branches using Pull Requests
- How to resolve merge conflicts

```bash
# üî∞ Basic Git Commands
git init                     # Initialize a new Git repository
git status                   # Show current status
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"      # Commit staged changes with a message
git push origin branch       # Push changes to GitHub
git pull origin branch       # Pull latest changes from GitHub
git checkout branch          # Switch to another branch
git branch                   # View all branches
git merge branch             # Merge specified branch into current branch
git checkout -b branch-name     # Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout main               # Switch back to main branch
git branch -D branch-name       # Delete a branch (safe delete, only if merged)
```

# üîÑ Undoing Changes

```bash
git restore filename         # Undo changes in working directory (untracked or modified)
git restore --staged filename # Unstage a file (move from staging back to working dir)
git reset HEAD~1             # Undo last commit but keep the changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1      # Completely remove last commit and changes (‚ö†Ô∏è irreversible)
git reset commit hash                 # commited changes (for many commits)
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Guidelines (Conventional Commits)
We follow the Conventional Commits format for writing meaningful commit messages.

###  Format

<type>(optional scope): <description>

### Example 

feat(auth): add user login form with validation

## Common Types

Type	      Use it for‚Ä¶              	                 Example

fix	          Bug fixes	                                 fix(api): correct response handling
docs	      Documentation only changes	             docs(readme): update installation steps
style	      Code style changes (white-space, etc.)	 style(home): fix indentation
refactor      Code refactoring (not bug fix or feat)	 refactor(nav): simplify logic
test	      Adding or updating tests	                 test(user): add unit test for login
